##### Articles and Tutorials
**notes**:

Used the following tutorials, articles and docs while building this app.

- *Tutorial Request: FEND Project 6 - Walk Through* by Ryan Waite, [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8bU1oWlLwY&feature=youtu.be) , [long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acJHkd6K5kI&=&feature=youtu.be)
The example for the updateBook function was helpful.  I examined the components breakdown and where to put state.
